- 👋 Hi, I’m @petersoncabrini, I'm a military firefighter, but I've always liked the idea of programming, and I'm working hard to make it happen! 
- 👀 I’m interested in learning new codes.
- 🌱 I'm currently learning a bit of front-end and back-end with javascript / html / css and node.js. 
- 💞️ I intend to acquire more knowledge in the area to be able to contribute in some way with the community.
- 📫 You can contact me right here on github, or Discord: Peterson / Mithr#8853.
